## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Gained a basic understanding of flexbox and learned about @media to change the flex-direction to a column orientation once the screen width fell below a threshold.


### Continued development

After using flexbox, I can see where creating components/elements from scratch as opposed to using Bootstrap can be highly beneficial with regard to fine tuning aspects of the design.


### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks: Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox) - This helped give me a baseline understanding of how flexbox works within CSS.
